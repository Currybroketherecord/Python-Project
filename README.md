# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes **COVID-19 trends** using country-wise case data. It explores **infection rates, mortality trends, recovery statistics, and vaccination progress** across different regions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Load and clean COVID-19 datasets.
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends.
- Compare infection & death rates across countries.
- Visualize key findings using Python libraries.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **pandas** (data manipulation)
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn** (data visualization)

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Run the Python script in Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
3. View the generated plots and insights.

## ðŸ”Ž Key Insights & Reflections
- Countries with **high population density** experienced **faster** spread.
- Comorbidities like **diabetes and obesity** increased **mortality risks**.
- The vaccination rollout **significantly reduced death rates** in most regions.
- **Early lockdown measures** helped curb rapid infections.
